** IJP Assignment 1, Version 18.1.3, 2018-10-30 10:52:23 **

What is all this? ....

- The jar file contains all of the required library classes
  for the assignment. You will need to include this when 
  compiling your project. See the FAQ on the course website for
  details of how to do this. The assignment web page also includes
  the Javadoc for all of these classes.

- The templates directory contains "starter" versions of some files.
  You will need to include these in your project at various stages
  and edit them appropriately. See the assignment sheet for details.

- The src directory contains source for some of the classes in
  the library. This is for your information only - you do not
  need to use any of these files. In particular, you should NOT 
  USE MODIFIED VERSIONS of these in your assignment. Some source
  files are not included because you will be expected to write
  your own version as part of the assignment. Note that this
  source code is not intended as an "exemplar" - you may well
  find code in here that is not easy to read or particularly
  well-written!
